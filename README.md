# HousingApp
This app takes in csv files of students and their preferred choices (first and second) of housing for the upcoming school year, 
as well as housing options with the avaiable spaces in the buildings. It then assigns the students to rooms based on preference.

It takes in two files, `student.csv` (containing students' first and second choices) and `housing.csv` (containing information on the number of seats in each dorm). 
It outputs the decided housing in `output.csv`. Please look at the sample files for more information on the layout. (Make sure the column names remain the same.)
